# CRAWL-Programming-language
A new programming language for course SER502 - Languages and Programming Paradigms

The language is strongly typed, simple and easily understood because of its strong influence from C, which is known to most beginners.  Since the language is high level, the keywords are more or less words from English language which are easy to remember and self explanatory.

ANTLR4 tool (Another Tool for Language Recognition) reads in the CRAWL program and abstract syntax trees (AST) and intermediate code for CRAWL is generated. The runtime environment is built using Java. 

The language is reliable, results consistent and tested rigorously. The programs can be run from the command prompt / terminal like any common shell program.
